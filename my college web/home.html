    <h3 class="h">Started with just one institute Shambhunath Institute of Engineering and Technology (SIET) in 2004, now SIET has been transformed into a group of institutions known as Shambhunath Group of Institutions. Under the aegis of Shambhunath Group of Institutions many institutes are flourishing. The journey of SGI started with its first institute i.e. Shambhunath Institute of Engineering and Technology, which is approved by AICTE and affiliated to Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Technical University, (formerly known as UPTU) Lucknow. The success of Shambhunath Institute of Engineering and Technology (SIET; Code-162) which started with just four disciplines i.e. Electronics and Communication (EC), Computer Science (CS), Electrical Engineering (EE) & Information Technology (IT) with an intake of 60 students in each in the year 2004; is continuing with a new chapter being added to nearly every year. In year 2006 a new institute named as Shambhunath Institute of Pharmacy (SIP; Code-241) affiliated to Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Technical University, was established. Another highlight in the year was adding one more branch of Engineering viz. Mechanical Engineering in SIET. In the year 2007 a course of Management, MBA started with an intake of 60 students. The intake of CS and EC was increased by 120 in each branch in the same year. The first batch of Engineering passed out in 2008. MBA 1st Batch passed out in 2009. In the year 2010 some more feathers were added in the cap of Shambhunath Group of Institutions. A new college for Management students; Shambhunath Institute of Management with an intake of 120 students (SIM; Code-727) affiliated to Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Technical University, was started. In the same year, SIET got approval for evening shift for EC and CS with an intake of 60 students in each. Approval for evening shift with an intake of 60 students in each of EE and M.E. was accorded to SIET in 2011.</h3>
